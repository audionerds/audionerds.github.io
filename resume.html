        <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently attending the USF Coding BootCamp, I have successfully
          completed several coding projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          showcasing my growing expertise in front-end development. One notable
          project is a memory card game, which challenges players to match pairs
          of cards within a set time limit, incorporating dynamic user
          interactions and responsive design. Additionally, I developed a meme
          generator that allows users to create and customize their own memes
          with ease, utilizing JavaScript to manage image uploads, text
          overlays, and styling options. These projects not only highlight my
          technical skills but also reflect my creativity and ability to build
          engaging, user-friendly web applications. There are more exciting
          projects to come as I continue to advance my coding skills and
          knowledge.

            <p>
              I created a memory card game as part of my projects at the USF
              Coding BootCamp. The game challenges players to match pairs of
              cards within a set time limit, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience. The
              responsive design ensures it works seamlessly across various
              devices, while the engaging gameplay highlights my ability to
              develop fun and user-friendly web applications.
