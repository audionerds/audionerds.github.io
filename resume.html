        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I contributed to several audio projects from 2014 to 2022 under Toes
          in the Sand Productions, LLC. These included recording and editing The
          Firewater Tent Revival's "Itch EP" and Amy Hendrickson's "Grit and
          Gold" album, as well as working on singles like Sizemore's "Good
          Stuff." Additionally, I was involved in Eades' "Apathy EP" and
          "Chivalry Died Alongside the Lady," focusing on recording, mixing, and
          post-production. My skills in audio engineering, Pro Tools, and
          critical thinking were crucial across these projects. Moreover, I
          participated in the "Local Honey Documentary," which aimed to promote
          local music through film, recording significant content at the
          historically significant Rodman Plantation.
